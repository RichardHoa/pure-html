          I can do backend and frontend, though my experience is more on the
          frontend side. In the mist of vibe-coding, I find much interest in
          cybersecurity, though if you want to build AI agent, I also can do it
          (sigh...)

        <h2>Why where is no style in this website?</h2>
        <p>
          Because there is no need to, it's a website that's blazingly fast,
          work on every single browser imaginable, full accessibility feature
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is created to showcase my project, and it does just that,
          and nothing else, there is no compatibility error, no Virtual DOM
          problem, no build step, no Docker, nothing.
        </p>
        <p>But it works</p>

            It's the kind of page that makes you want to weep tears of joy and
            throw your overpriced JavaScript framework out the window. It's the
            kind of page that makes you want to quit your job and become a
            full-time HTML evangelist. It's the kind of page that makes you want
            to start a cult dedicated to the worship of HTML. It's the kind of
            page that makes you want to write a love letter to HTML and send it
            to the HTML gods. It's the kind of page that makes you want to build
            a shrine to HTML in your living room and invite all your friends
            over for a candlelit HTML worship session. It's the kind of page

            tutorials and rants. It's the kind of page that makes you want to
            write a book about HTML and self-publish it on Amazon. It's the kind

            HTML and post daily HTML dance videos. It's the kind of page that
            makes you want to start a LinkedIn account dedicated to HTML and
            connect with other HTML professionals.
