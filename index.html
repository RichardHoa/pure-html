          The title has said enough about me, I can do backend and frontend,
          though my experience is more on the frontend side. I'm very curious
          about cypersecurity and is currently deep dive into it
        </p>

          I believe in not wasting other people time and keep thing short and
          simple, you can view my resume

          I don't like to introduce you 10+ different projects that do not
          matter, belows are my most proudest projects so far. There are not
          many of thems, the reason is I often devote time to a small number of
          projects, then learn 20+ courses to come back and improve those
          projects.

        <h2>Why where is no style in this website?</h2>
        <p>
          As I frontend dev, after been through the React, Next, whatever next
          js framework, framework has their strength only when you require a
          complicated website, I do not need so, at the core I pride myself as a
          problem solver. A problem solver solve the problem without bringing
          10.000 dependency into the project
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is created to showcase my project, and it does just that,
          and nothing else, there is no compatibility error, no Virtual DOM
          problem, no build step, no Docker, nothing.
        </p>
        <p>But it works</p>

            It's the kind of page that makes you want to weep tears of joy and
            throw your overpriced JavaScript framework out the window. It's the
            kind of page that makes you want to quit your job and become a
            full-time HTML evangelist. It's the kind of page that makes you want
            to start a cult dedicated to the worship of HTML. It's the kind of
            page that makes you want to write a love letter to HTML and send it

            a shrine to HTML in your living room and invite all your friends
            over for a candlelit HTML worship session. It's the kind of page

            tutorials and rants. It's the kind of page that makes you want to
            write a book about HTML and self-publish it on Amazon. It's the kind

            HTML and post daily HTML dance videos. It's the kind of page that
            makes you want to start a LinkedIn account dedicated to HTML and
            connect with other HTML professionals.
